# Meme Generator (Study Project)

A meme generator that let's you put your own text on classic memes.

## How to Use
1. Due to limitations of the Meme Generator API, this meme generator only provides a preview for memes with two boxes in the iconic top-bottom pattern.

    For memes with more than two text boxes or two with off-pattern placement, please use the <b>generate button</b> to see an accurate (but static) result. 
    
    (Two-text box images with off-placement will have a preview with off-placed text boxes.)

2. Make sure to provide the username and password from your own <a href= https://imgflip.com/api> imgflip account</a> to a `credentials.js` file as shown in the `credentials (example).js` file if you want to use the generate button function.
